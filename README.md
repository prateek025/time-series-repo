# Time Series Forecasting

## I. Repository Overview
- This repository contains notebooks covering different Machine Learning techniques ranging from statistics models such as ETS to deep learning models such as RNN to make forecasts on time series data. Some notebooks cover forecasting on univariate time series data, while others forecasting on multivariate time series data.
- Currently 4 notebooks are available in this repository:
  1. `nlp_classfication_lstm.ipynb`
  2. ``
  3. `time-series-rnn.ipynb`

## II. Tutorial notebooks details
1. **`nlp_classfication_lstm.ipynb`**

2. **`nlp_classfication_lstm.ipynb`**

3. **`time-series-rnn.ipynb`**
- **Time Series Forecasting using Recurrent Neural Network** : This tutorial covers developing RNN models to predict forecasts for a time series data. All model development has been done under `Tensorflow` framework.
- Monthly anti-diabetic drug sales : [a10](https://rdrr.io/cran/fpp/man/a10.html) dataset from the `fpp` package in R language has been taken for model development.
- Different combinations of architecture (single vs multiple layers of `SimpleRNN`) and parameters(`Adam` vs `SGD` optimizer) were tried to build multiple RNN models.
